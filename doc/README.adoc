= Troubleshooting Panel User Guide
:doctype: book
:toc: left

The troubleshooting panel displays a graph of related resources and observability signals.
Clicking on a node in the graph opens a console page showing the details of each resource or signal.
Nodes in the graph represent a type of resource or signal, while edges represent relationships.

The panel provides a map of related information, so you can navigate more quickly to relevant data.
It may also help to find related information that you were not aware of.

Consider an example of troubleshooting an Alert on the OCP console.

== Opening the panel

First open the alert of interest in the console.
Now open the troubleshooting panel [FIXME screenshot of global button ]

Opening the panel shows a _neighbourhood_ of the resource currently displayed in the console.
A neighbourhood is a graph that starts at the current resource, and includes related objects up to
3 steps away from the starting point.

NOTE: Not all resource types are currently supported, more will be added in future.
For an unsupported resource, the panel will be empty.

<1> Alert(1): This node represents the starting point, a `KubeContainerWaiting` alert that was displayed in the console.
<2> Pod(1): This node indicates there is a single Pod resource associated with this alert. Clicking on this node will show the pod details in the console.
<3> Event(2): There are two kuberenetes events associated with the Pod, and you can see them by clicking this node.
<3> Logs(74): The pod has emitted 74 lines of logs. Click to show them.
<4> Metrics(105): There are always many metrics associated with every Pod.
<6> Network(6): There are network events associated with the pod, which means it has communicated with other resources in the cluster.
    The remaining Service, Deployment and DaemonSet nodes are the resources that the pod has communicated with.
<7> Focus: Clicking nodes changes what is shown in the main console. You can navigate using links on the console page while the panel is open.
    The graph will not change until you click "Focus".
    This will draw a new graph starting from the resource shown in the main console.
<8> Show Query: enables experimental features detailed below.

NOTE: Clicking on a node may sometimes show fewer results than are indicated on the graph.
This is a known issue that will be addressed in future.

== Experimental features

[.border]
image::images/query-details.png[]

<1> Hide Query hides the experimental features.
<2> The query that identifies the starting point for the graph. The format of this query is experimental and may change in future.
    footnote:[This query language is part of https://korrel8r.github.io/korrel8r[Korrel8r], the correlation engine used to create the graphs]
    The "Focus" button updates the query to match the resources in the main console window.
<3> Neighbourhood depth: increase or decrease to see a smaller or larger neighbourhood.
    Note: setting a large value in a large cluster may cause the query to fail if the number of results is too big.
<4> Goal class: Selecting this option will do a _goal directed search_ instead of a neighbourhood search.
    A goal directed search will show all paths from the starting point to the goal _class_ , which indicates a type of resource or signal.

The format of the goal class is experimental and may change. The valid goal classes are:

[horizontal]
`k8s:__resource[.version.[group]]__` ::  Kind of Kuberenetes resource. For example `k8s:Pod` or `k8s:Deployment.apps.v1`.
`alert:alert`:: Any alert.
`metric:metric`:: Any metric.
`netflow:network`:: Any network observability event.
`log:__log_type__`:: Stored logs,  __log_type__ must be `application`, `infrastructure` or `audit`

== Optional signal stores

The troubleshooting panel relies on the observability signal stores installed in your cluster.
Kuberenetes resources, alerts and metrics are available by default in an OCP cluster.
Other types of signal require optional components to be installed:

- Logs: "Red Hat Openshift Logging" (collection) and "Loki Operator provided by Red Hat" (store)
- Network Events:  "Network Observability provided by Red Hat"  (collection) and "Loki Operator provided by Red Hat" (store)
